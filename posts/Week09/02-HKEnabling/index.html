Note: This is an older video using an earlier version of Xcode, but the steps taken are the same, aside from differences in the Xcode UI for adding capabilities.

</center><p class="new">You must use either a paid developer account or your "personal team" account to use HealthKit - this is a chance since this video was made.</p><p>Let's look at how to setup your project to use HealthKit. Access to HealthKit is only available with a paid developer account, or your "personal team" account (it is unfortunately not available with the University Developer program account). Enabling your app for HealthKit is really easy. In your project, select the project file, choose the main app target if it isn’t already chosen, and go to the Capabilities tab. There, click on the "Add Capabilities" button.</p><img src="../../../week09/HKCapabilities.png#centerResizedSlide" alt="HealthKit Capabilities"/><p>Search and select the HealthKit entry and just like that, your project is ready to use HealthKit! An entitlements file has been added to your project, which states that it is asking for permission to use HealthKit, and in your Info.plist file, under the required device capabilities, HealthKit has been added. Remember, HealthKit is not available on iPad. Going over to the general tab under your target, and scrolling to the bottom, you can see that the HealthKit framework has been added to your list of linked frameworks.</p><p>The Info.plist file can be updated to include some privacy strings. Remember, Apple is big on privacy, and wants to make sure the user is aware that you are using their private information - and their health information is included in that. Add 2 new rows to the Info.plist, and start typing “Privacy - Health” in each, and autocomplete will narrow down the list of choices to 2 - one that is called Health Share Usage, which is displayed when explaining why your app wants to read data from the HealthKit store, and Health Update Usage, which is displayed when explaining why your app wants to write data to the HealthKit store.</p><img src="../../../week09/HKPermissions.png#centerResizedSlide" alt="HealthKit Capabilities"/><p>Finally, there is one more things we can do before making our app - and that’s adding data to the simulator’s Health App. Normally this data will come from the user’s own health data, but in the simulator, we need some dummy information. Open the simulator, open the health app, and select the Health Data tab. In the upper right you’ll see a person icon - click that, and you can set bogus information about the person’s name, date of birth, and more.</p><img src="../../../week09/HKEditProfile.png#centerResizedSlide" alt="HealthKit Capabilities"/><p>Then, go back to the health data tab, and choose Body measurements. I’ve already added in a weight from earlier, and if you click on the weight row you can see a plot of the entered data over various periods of time. The plus in the upper right lets you add new data to the simulator. I can also go into the Activity section in the Health Data tab and add some steps - I’ve already entered a number here that we’ll use in the demo.</p><img src="../../../week09/HKMeasurements.png#centerResizedSlide" alt="HealthKit Body Measurements"/><p>As you can see, setting up HealthKit is easy, and you can even add simulated health data to the Health App in order to make your testing be more realistic.<br><br>If you have any questions about the examples in this video, please post them in the forums.</p><p style="float: left">Previous:  <A HREF="../01-IntroductionToHealthKit/index.html">Introduction to HealthKit</A></p><p style="float: right">Next:  <A HREF="../03-HKAccess/index.html" class="nextModule">Getting HealthKit Access</A></p></div><footer><p>Generated with ❤️ using <a href="https://github.com/johnsundell/publish">Publish</a></p><p>© 2023-2024 Josh Steele (rsteele3@jhu.edu) <a href="mailto:"(rsteele3@jhu.edu)""></a></p><p>Last updated January 21, 2024 at 1:48 PM</p><p><a href="https://mastodon.social/@hococoder" target="_blank">My Mastodon</a> | <a href="https://github.com/hococoder" target="_blank">My GitHub</a> | <a href="https://ep.jhu.edu" target="_blank">Whiting School EPP</a> | <a href="https://canvas.jhu.edu" target="_blank">JHU Canvas</a></p></footer></body></html>
