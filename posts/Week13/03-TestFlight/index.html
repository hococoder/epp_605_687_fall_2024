TestFlight provides:</p><ul><li>Both internal (to your Apple Developer account team) and external testers</li><li>Up to 100 internal testers (no beta app review required)</li><li>Up to 10,000 external testers! (requires a beta app review, which is usually less than a day)</li><li>Different testing groups</li><li>Testing either by email address or a direct link</li><li>The ability for your users to send feedback directly from your app by taking a screenshot</li><li>The ability for your users to provide additional information when a crash occurs</li><li>The ability to review screenshots and crash reports right in App Store Connect!</li><li>Each beta lasts 90 days</li></ul><p>Let's touch on some of these areas briefly.</p><h3>Getting your App ready for TestFlight</h3><p>Once you have information filled in App Store Connect, you will see a "TestFlight" section. The screenshot below shows the "Test Information" section, where you can add a description and other details like you filled in the App Store section of App Store Connect. You can also fill in any information needed for the beta app review, which is required on the first submission to external testers. This can include sample user login information, also similar to what is placed in the App Store tab.</p><img src="../../../week13/Testflight.png#centerResizedSlide" alt="TestFlight"/><p>Once apps have been submitted to App Store Connect (typically from Xcode), builds will appear in the "Builds" section on the left.</p><h3>Internal Testers</h3><p>With an app build in place, you can add users the Internal Testing group. These users are part of your development team that have certain roles. Internal testing is used to get an initial round of testing on your app before it goes to a wider, external, and public audience. Internal TestFlight versions do NOT require a beta review by Apple, and can include up to 100 testers.</p><h3>External Testers</h3><p>Once you get good feedback from your internal testers, it's time to beta test your app with a wider set of users. Once internal testers become active, you'll get the chance to add external testers - up to 10,000! - either through email or public links. Before this build of your app goes out to testers though, it has to go through an initial beta app review by Apple. This typically takes on the order of a day. Once it is approved, the app will go out to your testers.</p><h3>Receiving Feedback</h3><p>The "Feedback" section in the screenshot above contains two sections - Crashes and Screenshots - and they contain exactly that! Crashes are automatically updated from your user's device when a crash occurs, and the user has the ability to add contextual information such as what they were doing when the crash occurs. The screenshots section contains screenshots users take while beta testing your app, and can be useful to show to odd user interface behavior.</p><h3>Future Builds</h3><p>Each build lasts 90 days before it expires. Once that happens (or beforehand, most likely, since you are responding to bugs and making fixes) you can add new builds to App Store Connect, and therefore TestFlight. You can configure TestFlight to automatically send those new builds out to your testers if so desire.</p><p style="float: left">Previous:  <A HREF="../02-IntroductionToAppStoreConnect/index.html">Introduction to App Store Connect</A></p><p style="float: right">Next:  <A HREF="../04-WWDC2023Recap/index.html" class="nextModule">WWDC 2023 Recap</A></p></div><footer><p>Generated with ❤️ using <a href="https://github.com/johnsundell/publish">Publish</a></p><p>© 2023-2024 Josh Steele (rsteele3@jhu.edu) <a href="mailto:"(rsteele3@jhu.edu)""></a></p><p>Last updated January 21, 2024 at 1:48 PM</p><p><a href="https://mastodon.social/@hococoder" target="_blank">My Mastodon</a> | <a href="https://github.com/hococoder" target="_blank">My GitHub</a> | <a href="https://ep.jhu.edu" target="_blank">Whiting School EPP</a> | <a href="https://canvas.jhu.edu" target="_blank">JHU Canvas</a></p></footer></body></html>
