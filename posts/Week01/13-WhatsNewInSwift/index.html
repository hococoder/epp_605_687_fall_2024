In fact, Swift Evolution is the name of the process by which new proposals are made for Swift, reviewed by the community, and brought into the main branch. You'll often see new features referred to by their "SE" number (like SE-131), which is the Swift Evolution proposal number.</p><h2>Swift 5.9</h2><p>One of the biggest updates in Swift 5.9 has to be Swift Macros. Swift Macros allow you to change your code at compile time, letting you avoid repetitive code written by hand. This is always an additive process; you can only add code, never modify or delete it. The generated code is checked for syntactical correctness, and the values you pass into a macro are checked for type correctness.<br><br>There are 2 types: - Freestanding macros appear on their own, without being attached to a declaration. These are called with a pound/hashtag symbol - Attached macros modify the declaration that they're attached to. These are called with an @ symbol, like property wrappers. Yes, this is confusing.</p><p>Attached macros are seen everywhere in the new way to deal with databases, SwiftData. You'll learn more about that in a few weeks.<br><br></p><p class="suggestedReading">

</p><h2>Some older additions</h2><p>Let's take a look at some of the new features have made their way into Swift 5.5 and Swift 5.7.</p><h3>Clock improvements</h3><p>Clocks, instants and durations are now easier to work with. You can simply write</p><pre><code>.<span class="property">now</span> + .<span class="call">seconds</span>(<span class="number">1</span>)
</code></pre><p>where before you had to deal with nanoseconds.</p><p>You can also measure how long it takes things to happen</p><pre><code><span class="keyword">let</span> clock = <span class="type">ContinuousClock</span>()

<span class="keyword">let</span> duration = clock.<span class="call">measure</span> {
  <span class="comment">//Stuff to do here</span>
}
</code></pre><h3>Regex</h3><p>Swift 5.7 also introduced a new Regex type:</p><pre><code><span class="keyword">let</span> regex1 = /(.+?)ful day/
<span class="keyword">let</span> phrase = <span class="string">"Wonderful day"</span>
<span class="keyword">if let</span> result2 = <span class="keyword">try</span> regex1.<span class="call">wholeMatch</span>(in: phrase) {
  <span class="call">print</span>(<span class="string">"Name:</span> \(result2.<span class="number">1</span>)<span class="string">"</span>)
}
</code></pre><p>These RegEx expressions are made from STRINGS! And they are checked for validity at COMPILE TIME! It's pretty amazing.</p><h3>Optionally add modifiers with #if</h3><p>Next week you'll learn about SwiftUI and modifiers which can be used to, well, modify those views. SwiftUI evolves pretty quickly as well, so you can now use <code>#if</code> to apply modifiers conditionally - which is useful if you have to change them based on iOS version or even platform.</p><pre><code><span class="type">Text</span>(<span class="string">"Hello 605.687!"</span>)
<span class="preprocessing">#if os(iOS)</span>
    .<span class="call">font</span>(.<span class="dotAccess">largeTitle</span>)
<span class="preprocessing">#else</span>
    .<span class="call">font</span>(.<span class="dotAccess">headline</span>)
<span class="preprocessing">#endif</span>
</code></pre><h3>Interchange CGFloat and Double</h3><p>Not every framework has been moved to Swift yet, and there are still some pain points. One of those used to be when working with frameworks like CoreGraphics that use such unique types as CGFloat. Luckily, as of Swift 5.5, you can now interchangeable use CGFloat and Double types, which eliminates a lot of unnecessary casting.</p><h3>Codable Synthesis with enums with associated values</h3><p>It used to be hard to conform Enums with associated values to the <code>Codable</code> protocol, especially since they can get complicated</p><pre><code><span class="keyword">enum</span> Vehicle: <span class="type">Codable</span> {
    <span class="keyword">case</span> bike
    <span class="keyword">case</span> car(cylinders: <span class="type">Int</span>)
    <span class="keyword">case</span> truck(horsePower: <span class="type">Double</span>, carryingWeight: <span class="type">Double</span>)
}
</code></pre><p>Before Swift 5.5 you had to make customized associated values for each type, but now Swift does this behind the scenes for you.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>These are just some of the new features in Swift 5.5, Swift 5.7, and Swift 5.9 - we'll discuss a few others later in the semester.</p><p>In the next module, you'll learn how to start putting some of these Swift concepts into practice.</p><p style="float: left">Previous:  <A HREF="../12-FunctionalProgramming/index.html">Functional Programming</A></p><p style="float: right">Next:  <A HREF="../../Week02/00-Week02Overview/index.html">Week 2 Overview</A></p></div><footer><p>Generated with ❤️ using <a href="https://github.com/johnsundell/publish">Publish</a></p><p>© 2023-2024 Josh Steele (rsteele3@jhu.edu) <a href="mailto:"(rsteele3@jhu.edu)""></a></p><p>Last updated January 21, 2024 at 1:48 PM</p><p><a href="https://mastodon.social/@hococoder" target="_blank">My Mastodon</a> | <a href="https://github.com/hococoder" target="_blank">My GitHub</a> | <a href="https://ep.jhu.edu" target="_blank">Whiting School EPP</a> | <a href="https://canvas.jhu.edu" target="_blank">JHU Canvas</a></p></footer></body></html>
