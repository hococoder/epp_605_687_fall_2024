</center><p>Hello everyone, my name is Josh Steele, and welcome to "Week 0" of 605.687, Mobile Applications for the iOS Platform. This module is designed to be reviewed before class officially starts, so we can hit the ground running in Week 1.</p><p>I'm very excited to introduce you to the world of programming for the iOS ecosystem - including iPhones, iPads, Apple TV, Apple Watch, even Macs - and who knows what else in the future!</p><p>In this module, we'll go over some class logistics, including the syllabus, class schedule, and grading criteria; how to properly download and install Xcode; and finally how to run a simple "Hello, World!" program on both a simulator and actual device.</p><p>The material for the modules for this class is presented in several different ways:</p><ul><li>The Website for the class, which is hosted on a GitHub pages site, linked from the Canvas for the course under "Course Content". This website contains what you might find when you go to any of the more popular sites on the web centered around iOS - prose, with embedded videos and code snippets to show you examples of what is being discussed</li></ul><ul><li>An Examples App - An examples app will be released at the start of the semester. It contains many of the examples that I will show in class, but in the form of an app you can view on your simulator. This app is provided as a reference you can use throughout the course. If you ever feel lost with how to do something in the class, check this project - it may give you pointers! Sometimes code will be included in Xcode Playgrounds which you can easy edit and rerun to see how your changes impact the results of the code.</li></ul><ul><li>Homeworks - At the end of each set of lecture material each week (weeks 1-12 only), I'll have you build components of a bigger "ToDo" App for your homework. I'll sometimes provide starter projects that you can use as the basis of your homework submissions, and your job will be to fill in what the assignment requires. Please note this is NOT YOUR FINAL PROJECT (see below) but simply assessments of how well you understand each week's content.</li></ul><h2>Semester Long Project</h2><p>Alongside the weekly homeworks, there will be a Semester Long Project that will be of your own making - you'll come up with requirements, sketch out user interfaces, define data flows, and implement your app during the semester! Start thinking about that app NOW, and starting in week 1, you'll start recording those ideas. You and I will come to an agreement on a scaled down version of that "dream app" you have, and that will be your goal for the end of the semester. I'm not expecting it to be able to go right into the App Store - instead, I want it to be of your own design and making, and demonstrate what you have learned in class.</p><h2>Get Ready for Week 1</h2><p>Completing this module, installing the proper software, and making the necessary accounts are all things that should be done <strong><em>before</em></strong> the first day of classes, so you can start learning from day 1. So without further ado...</p><p>Let's get started!</p><center><p style="float: center" class="download"><A HREF="http://159.203.191.136/current/Week00Download.zip">Downlink Week 0 Materials</A></p></center><p style="float: right">Next:  <A HREF="../01-ClassLogistics/index.html" class="nextModule">Class Logistics</A></p></div><footer><p>Generated with ❤️ using <a href="https://github.com/johnsundell/publish">Publish</a></p><p>© 2023-2024 Josh Steele (rsteele3@jhu.edu) <a href="mailto:"(rsteele3@jhu.edu)""></a></p><p>Last updated January 21, 2024 at 1:48 PM</p><p><a href="https://mastodon.social/@hococoder" target="_blank">My Mastodon</a> | <a href="https://github.com/hococoder" target="_blank">My GitHub</a> | <a href="https://ep.jhu.edu" target="_blank">Whiting School EPP</a> | <a href="https://canvas.jhu.edu" target="_blank">JHU Canvas</a></p></footer></body></html>
