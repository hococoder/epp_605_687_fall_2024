</center><p class="new">If you have an M1 Mac you must go the ResearchKit project -> Build Settings -> Excluded Architectures and enter arm64 for it to build correctly on your simulator.  See the screenshot below</p><img src="../../../week10/RK-ExcludedArchitectures.png#centerResizedSlide" alt="Excluded Architectures"/><p>ResearchKit allows you to make powerful apps that can collect medical research data. The main modules of ResearchKit include surveys, digital consent, and active tasks. It can also interoperate with HealthKit to provide a better picture of overall health.</p><h2>Why ResearchKit?</h2><p>There are plenty of medical research studies that happen every day - so why would you want to make an app that does the same thing? Well, many of us carry iOS devices, which can record or measure health related data. Also - it’s very difficult to get participants into those studies (due to scheduling conflicts, distance to travel, etc), so the amount of participants is typically well below the desired amount for the study. Finally - the gathered data can be shared with the user to give them a better sense of their own health.</p><p>ResearchKit is also open source - and on Github (which is a rarity for Apple!). Apple accepts pull requests, and there have been contributions from outside Apple over the years. It can be installed via CocoaPods, git submodules, or by downloading the project and dragging the framework into your project.</p><p>Here’s a list of current popular ResearchKit apps. The first 5 were available at the launch of ResearchKit a few years ago, and the others have come on board since then. Universities and Medical centers are the main contributors, and research areas range from Autism to Heart health and everything in between.</p><h2>What can you do with ResearchKit?</h2><ul><li>The visual consent module allows you to present consent forms and capture their digital signature (which they do by using their finger to sign on the screen).</li><li>The surveys module provides built in question types (ratings, yes/no, fill in the blank) to present to the user in order to collect information.</li><li>Active tasks allow you to use the onboard sensors as well as interactions with the screen, to evaluate how well the participants can perform given tasks.</li><li>Charts module allows you to display pie charts, line charts, and discrete graph charts to present data to the user.</li></ul><p>There are a few things ResearchKit can’t do:</p><ul><li>It doesn’t handle any back end services, so you’ll need to setup a service on your server for the app to send the data to (and make sure to encrypt that data during transit)!</li><li>It also can’t make your user input data - so be sure to add a proper level of user engagement to your app to remind them to input data, and have your app be one of the apps your user opens every day.</li></ul><h2>Example - Adding ResearchKit to your App</h2><center> <iframe width="1280" height="720" src="https://cdnapisec.kaltura.com/html5/html5lib/v2.81.2/mwEmbedFrame.php/p/1458241/uiconf_id/14487351/entry_id/1_sngcnd70?wid=_1458241&iframeembed=true&playerId=kaltura_player&entry_id=1_sngcnd70&flashvars[localizationCode]=en&amp;flashvars[leadWithHTML5]=true&amp;flashvars[sideBarContainer.plugin]=true&amp;flashvars[sideBarContainer.position]=left&amp;flashvars[sideBarContainer.clickToClose]=true&amp;flashvars[chapters.plugin]=true&amp;flashvars[chapters.layout]=vertical&amp;flashvars[chapters.thumbnailRotator]=false&amp;flashvars[streamSelector.plugin]=true&amp;flashvars[EmbedPlayer.SpinnerTarget]=videoHolder&amp;flashvars[dualScreen.plugin]=true&amp;flashvars[mediaProxy.preferedFlavorBR]=2500&amp;flashvars[Kaltura.addCrossoriginToIframe]=true&amp;flashvars[EmbedPlayer.NotPlayableDownloadLink]=true;&wid=1_abkvs1gz"allowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen mozAllowFullScreen allow="autoplay *; fullscreen *; encrypted-media *" sandbox="allow-forms allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-top-navigation allow-pointer-lock allow-popups allow-modals allow-orientation-lock allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox allow-presentation allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation" frameborder="0" title="Kaltura Player">

Note: This is an older video using an earlier version of Xcode and ResearchKit, but the steps are the same.
</p>
</center><p>Let's look at how to install ResearchKit in your app. You’ll have to go to <a href="http://researchkit.org">researchkit.org</a> and download the zip file of the latest release. Expand the files somewhere on your drive - I’ve chosen the desktop for this example (although for the purposes of your homeworks, it might be best to place it along side the xcodeproj file for your project, so you remember to bundle the ResearchKit code with everything else!).</p><p>Open up the folder, and drag the ResearchKit.xcodeproj file from the folder to your Xcode project, and place it right below the xcodeproj file in your file tree. This embeds the research kit project in your project, and allows you to import the framework. First though, you have to go to the project file of your project, scroll down to the bottom and under "Frameworks, Libraries and Embedded Cotent", press the plus sign, and choose the ResearchKit framework. Now if you go to your code, you can import the ResearchKit framework and it compiles correctly. It does have to build ResearchKit in addition to your project, so it takes a little longer than usual, at least on the first build. Now since ResearchKit is installed, you can start making an app to collect some medical research.<br><br>If you have any questions about the examples in this video, please post them in the forums.</p><p style="float: left">Previous:  <A HREF="../06-Biometrics/index.html">Biometrics</A></p><p style="float: right">Next:  <A HREF="../08-RKConsentPart1/index.html" class="nextModule">ResearchKit Consent (Part 1)</A></p></div><footer><p>Generated with ❤️ using <a href="https://github.com/johnsundell/publish">Publish</a></p><p>© 2023-2024 Josh Steele (rsteele3@jhu.edu) <a href="mailto:"(rsteele3@jhu.edu)""></a></p><p>Last updated January 21, 2024 at 1:48 PM</p><p><a href="https://mastodon.social/@hococoder" target="_blank">My Mastodon</a> | <a href="https://github.com/hococoder" target="_blank">My GitHub</a> | <a href="https://ep.jhu.edu" target="_blank">Whiting School EPP</a> | <a href="https://canvas.jhu.edu" target="_blank">JHU Canvas</a></p></footer></body></html>
